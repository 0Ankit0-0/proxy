# Project Quorum - Status Report (2025-10-25)

This report summarizes the recent changes made to the Project Quorum codebase, including fixes based on the comprehensive review and updates to documentation.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Frontend
- **Dependency Fix:** Resolved a critical issue preventing the frontend application from starting by installing all missing npm packages (`framer-motion`, `react-hot-toast`, `lucide-react`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `class-variance-authority`, `recharts`). The frontend development server can now be run successfully.

### Backend & Core Fixes (from code review)

-   **Issue #1: Missing Core Requirement - TTP Detection**: **FIXED**.
    -   Integrated a new `DetectionEngine` in `backend/core/detection_engine.py`.
    -   Added support for TTP-based detection using MITRE ATT&CK patterns.
    -   Included offline threat intelligence matching and a rule-based detection mechanism.
    -   Populated initial TTP patterns, detection rules, and threat intelligence indicators.

-   **Issue #2: SQL Injection Vulnerability**: **FIXED**.
    -   Replaced the vulnerable raw SQL query endpoint (`/logs/query`) in `backend/routes/logs.py`.
    -   Implemented a secure, whitelisted query system that only allows pre-defined, safe queries.

-   **Issue #3: No EVTX Parser**: **FIXED**.
    -   Added a robust EVTX (Windows Event Log) parser to `backend/services/parser_service.py`.
    -   Integrated the new parser into the main log processing pipeline, enabling proper parsing of `.evtx` files.
    -   Verified that the `python-evtx` dependency is listed in `requirements.txt`.

-   **Issue #4: Memory Leak in Batch Insert**: **FIXED**.
    -   Patched the memory leak in the `insert_polars_df` function in `backend/services/storage_service.py`.
    -   The fix involves unregistering the temporary `batch_df` from the DuckDB connection in each iteration of the batch insertion loop.

-   **Issue #5: No Public Key for SOUP**: **FIXED**.
    -   Generated a new RSA key pair for signing and verifying SOUP (Secure Offline Update Protocol) packages.
    -   The public key (`quorum_public.pem`) is now present in `backend/routes/`.
    -   The code in `backend/routes/soup.py` was already correctly implemented to use this key.

-   **Issue #7: No Log Deduplication**: **FIXED**.
    -   Implemented log deduplication in `backend/services/storage_service.py`.
    -   The database schema in `backend/core/database.py` has been updated with a `content_hash` column and a unique index to prevent duplicate entries.

-   **Issue #8 & #10: USB Detection Broken on Linux / Windows-Only**: **FIXED**.
    -   Replaced the platform-specific USB detection logic in `backend/services/collector_service.py` with a cross-platform implementation using the `psutil` library.

-   **Issue #9: No Audit Logging**: **FIXED**.
    -   Implemented audit logging for SOUP updates in `backend/routes/soup.py`.

### Documentation Updates

-   **`requirements.txt`**: Updated with the latest versions for all backend dependencies to ensure a reproducible environment.
-   **`run.md`**: Completely rewritten to provide a clear and comprehensive guide for setting up and running the backend. Includes improved instructions for frontend developers and an updated project structure.
-   **`API_ENDPOINTS.md`**: Updated the documentation for the `/analysis/comprehensive` endpoint with a more detailed and accurate example of the API response.
-   **`progress_report.md`**: Updated to reflect the current status of the project, including recent frontend progress and a more realistic overall progress estimate.

## ðŸ“‹ What is Left

-   **AI Model Training**: The enhanced AI model needs to be trained using the provided script (`enhanced_training.py`) on a suitable environment (like Google Colab). The resulting model files (`.pkl`, `.tflite`, etc.) must then be copied to the `backend/data/models/` directory to be used by the new detection engine.
-   **Frontend Integration**: The frontend needs to be fully integrated with the backend API endpoints.
-   **Authentication**: A proper authentication system should be implemented to track which user performs which action.
-   **Comprehensive Testing**: The entire system should be tested end-to-end to ensure all components work together as expected.

This concludes the summary of the work done. The project is now in a much more robust and feature-complete state, with improved documentation to facilitate development.
