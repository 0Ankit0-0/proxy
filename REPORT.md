# Project Quorum - Status Report (2025-10-24)

This report summarizes the changes made to the Project Quorum codebase based on the comprehensive review provided.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

All critical and high-priority issues identified in the review have been addressed.

### Priority 1: MUST FIX (Blocks Evaluation)

-   **Issue #1: Missing Core Requirement - TTP Detection**: **FIXED**.
    -   Integrated a new `DetectionEngine` in `backend/core/detection_engine.py`.
    -   Added support for TTP-based detection using MITRE ATT&CK patterns.
    -   Included offline threat intelligence matching and a rule-based detection mechanism.
    -   Populated initial TTP patterns, detection rules, and threat intelligence indicators.

-   **Issue #2: SQL Injection Vulnerability**: **FIXED**.
    -   Replaced the vulnerable raw SQL query endpoint (`/logs/query`) in `backend/routes/logs.py`.
    -   Implemented a secure, whitelisted query system that only allows pre-defined, safe queries.

-   **Issue #3: No EVTX Parser**: **FIXED**.
    -   Added a robust EVTX (Windows Event Log) parser to `backend/services/parser_service.py`.
    -   Integrated the new parser into the main log processing pipeline, enabling proper parsing of `.evtx` files.
    -   Verified that the `python-evtx` dependency is listed in `requirements.txt`.

-   **Issue #4: Memory Leak in Batch Insert**: **FIXED**.
    -   Patched the memory leak in the `insert_polars_df` function in `backend/services/storage_service.py`.
    -   The fix involves unregistering the temporary `batch_df` from the DuckDB connection in each iteration of the batch insertion loop.

-   **Issue #5: No Public Key for SOUP**: **FIXED**.
    -   Generated a new RSA key pair for signing and verifying SOUP (Secure Offline Update Protocol) packages.
    -   The public key (`quorum_public.pem`) is now present in `backend/routes/`.
    -   The code in `backend/routes/soup.py` was already correctly implemented to use this key.

### Priority 2: SHOULD FIX (Affects Scoring)

-   **Issue #6: Undertrained AI Model**: **Partially Addressed**.
    -   The script for the enhanced training pipeline (`enhanced_training.py`) has been created and is available in the `training_model_code` directory.
    -   As requested, the actual training will be performed on Colab. The new models can then be integrated into the backend.

-   **Issue #7: No Log Deduplication**: **FIXED**.
    -   Implemented log deduplication in `backend/services/storage_service.py`.
    -   The database schema in `backend/core/database.py` has been updated with a `content_hash` column and a unique index to prevent duplicate entries.
    -   The insertion logic now calculates a SHA256 hash of the raw log content and filters out duplicates before insertion.

-   **Issue #8 & #10: USB Detection Broken on Linux / Windows-Only**: **FIXED**.
    -   Replaced the platform-specific USB detection logic in `backend/services/collector_service.py` with a cross-platform implementation using the `psutil` library.

-   **Issue #9: No Audit Logging**: **FIXED**.
    -   Implemented audit logging for SOUP updates in `backend/routes/soup.py`.
    -   The `save_update_history` function now records the source IP and a user placeholder (`anonymous`) for each update attempt and stores it in a dedicated audit log file (`soup_audit.log`).

### Medium Priority Issues

-   **Parser Regex is Fragile**: **FIXED**.
    -   Enhanced the syslog parser in `backend/services/parser_service.py` to support both BSD-style and RFC5424 syslog formats.
    -   The file was also cleaned up to remove corrupted code from previous edits.

## เหลืออะไร (What is Left)

-   **AI Model Training**: The enhanced AI model needs to be trained using the provided script (`enhanced_training.py`) on a suitable environment (like Google Colab). The resulting model files (`.pkl`, `.tflite`, etc.) must then be copied to the `backend/data/models/` directory to be used by the new detection engine.
-   **Frontend Integration**: The frontend needs to be updated to interact with the new and modified API endpoints.
-   **Authentication**: The audit logging feature currently uses a placeholder for the username. A proper authentication system should be implemented to track which user performs which action.
-   **Comprehensive Testing**: While individual fixes have been implemented, the entire system should be tested end-to-end to ensure all components work together as expected.

This concludes the summary of the work done. The project is now in a much more robust and feature-complete state.
