## 🎯 **Remaining Development Tasks**

### **High Priority (Week 1-2)**
1. **AI Model Training**: Train the enhanced AI model using the `enhanced_training.py` script and integrate the new models.
2. **Frontend Development**: Build a minimal viable dashboard for log upload, analysis, and results visualization.
3. **Verify Test Suite**: Run all tests, align them with the current fixed codebase, and ensure the CI pipeline is green.

### **Medium Priority (Week 3-4)**
1. **Implement SOUP Rollback**: Change the simulated rollback to a functional one.
2. **Advanced Analysis**: Implement trend analysis and correlation detection.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Introduce parallel processing and log compression.

### **Low Priority (Week 5+)**
1. **Authentication System**: Fully integrate JWT-based user management and access control.
2. **Advanced Protocols**: Add SNMP support if required.
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Create a real-time system monitoring dashboard.

## 🔐 **Security Assessment**

### **Implemented Security**
- ✅ AES-256 encryption for data at rest.
- ✅ Environment variable security via `.env`.
- ✅ **SQL Injection Fixed**: Replaced vulnerable endpoint with a secure, whitelisted query system.
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization.
- ✅ **Hardened SOUP**: Update signature verification is now mandatory and enforced.
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: Audit trail for all SOUP update operations.

### **Security Gaps**
- ⚠️ No functional user authentication or authorization system.
