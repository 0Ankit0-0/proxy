- **Input Validation**: SQL injection prevention.
- **SOUP Foundation**: Secure Offline Update Protocol with enforced signature validation.

#### **7. API Endpoints**
- **Health Checks**: System status monitoring.
- **Log Management**: Upload, collect, parse, store operations.
- **Analysis**: AI-powered anomaly detection.
- **Query Interface**: SQL-based log querying.
- **SOUP Updates**: Offline update mechanism with robust security checks.

#### **8. Reporting**
- **Multi-format Export**: PDF, CSV, and JSON export capabilities are implemented.

### 🚧 **Partially Implemented Features (15% Complete)**

#### **SOUP (Secure Offline Update Protocol)**
- ✅ Framework with encryption and enforced signature validation.
- ✅ Update endpoints implemented.
- ⚠️ **Missing**: Full atomic updates and functional rollback capabilities (currently simulated). Public key deployment is required for signature verification to pass.

#### **Frontend Dashboard**
- ✅ React setup with Vite build system.
- ✅ Basic project structure.
- ⚠️ **Missing**: UI components, data visualization, API integration, and interactive features.

#### **Advanced Analysis**
- ✅ Basic anomaly detection is functional.
- ⚠️ **Missing**: Trend analysis, correlation detection, advanced reporting visualizations.

#### **Testing Framework**
- ✅ Comprehensive unit and integration tests exist.
- ⚠️ **Status**: Critical backend bugs that would cause test failures have been fixed. Tests now need to be run and aligned with the current implementation to ensure they pass.

### ❌ **Not Implemented Features (5% Complete)**

#### **Network Protocols**
- ❌ SNMP protocol support (mentioned in requirements but not implemented).

#### **Authentication & Authorization**
- ❌ User authentication system (JWT framework is present but not fully integrated).
- ❌ Role-based access control.
- ❌ Session management.

#### **Advanced Reporting**
- ❌ Scheduled reports.
- ❌ Custom report templates.

#### **Performance Optimization**
- ❌ Log compression.
- ❌ Parallel processing for collection/parsing.
- ❌ Memory optimization for large datasets.

## 🎯 **Remaining Development Tasks**

### **High Priority (Week 1-2)**
1. **Verify Test Suite**: Run all tests, align them with the current fixed codebase, and ensure the CI pipeline is green.
2. **Deploy SOUP Public Key**: Generate and deploy the `quorum_public.pem` to enable successful update verifications.
3. **Frontend Development**: Build a minimal viable dashboard for log upload, analysis, and results visualization.

### **Medium Priority (Week 3-4)**
1. **Implement SOUP Rollback**: Change the simulated rollback to a functional one.
2. **Advanced Analysis**: Implement trend analysis and correlation detection.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Introduce parallel processing and log compression.

### **Low Priority (Week 5+)**
1. **Authentication System**: Fully integrate JWT-based user management and access control.
2. **Advanced Protocols**: Add SNMP support if required.
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Create a real-time system monitoring dashboard.

## 🔐 **Security Assessment**

### **Implemented Security**
- ✅ AES-256 encryption for data at rest.
- ✅ Environment variable security via `.env`.
- ✅ SQL injection prevention.
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization.
- ✅ **Hardened SOUP**: Update signature verification is now mandatory and enforced. An update will fail safely if the public key is missing.

### **Security Gaps**
- ⚠️ No functional user authentication or authorization system.
- ⚠️ No audit logging for user actions.
