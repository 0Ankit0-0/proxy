- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based config with `.env` support.
- **Directory Structure**: Organized codebase with clear separation of concerns.

#### **2. Log Collection System**
- **Local System Logs**:
  - ✅ Linux: `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/messages`, journalctl
  - ✅ Windows: Event Logs (System, Application, Security) via wevtutil
  - ✅ macOS: System logs and Unified Logging
- **File Upload**: Supports .log, .txt, .evtx, .json, .csv, .gz formats.
- **Directory Collection**: Import from USB drives or network shares.
- **Remote Collection**: SSH (Linux), WinRM (Windows), and FTP/FTPS support.
- **Cross-Platform USB Detection**: Now uses `psutil` for reliable cross-platform removable drive detection.

#### **3. Log Processing Pipeline**
- **Multi-Format Parsers**: Now supports **BSD Syslog**, **RFC5424 Syslog**, **JSON**, **EVTX**, and generic text formats.
- **Structured Storage**: Polars DataFrames with unified schema.
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatic format detection and parser selection.
- **Metadata Preservation**: Source files, timestamps, host information.

#### **4. Database & Storage**
- **DuckDB Integration**: Embedded analytical database.
- **Schema Design**: Proper indexing for performance and new columns for enhanced analysis.
- **Log Deduplication**: Automatic deduplication of logs based on content hash.
- **Batch Operations**: Optimized insertion for large datasets with memory leak fix.
- **Query Interface**: Secure, whitelisted SQL-based log querying.

#### **5. AI Analysis Engine**
- **Multi-Layered Detection**: A new `DetectionEngine` provides a multi-layered approach:
    - ✅ **Anomaly Detection**: IsolationForest + TF-IDF vectorization.
    - ✅ **TTP-Based Detection**: Maps log events to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
    - ✅ **Threat Intelligence**: Matches against offline IoC database (IPs, domains, hashes).
    - ✅ **Rule-Based Detection**: Custom detection rules for specific patterns.
- **Model Loading**: Pre-trained models from local storage.
- **Scoring System**: Anomaly scores with severity classification.
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient analysis of large log volumes.

#### **6. Security Framework**
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for sensitive data.
- **Environment Security**: Secure key management via `.env` file.
- **SQL Injection Fixed**: The raw query endpoint has been replaced with a secure, whitelisted system.
- **SOUP Hardened**: 
    - ✅ Secure Offline Update Protocol with enforced signature validation.
    - ✅ Public key is now deployed, allowing for successful signature verification.
    - ✅ Audit logging for all update operations is now implemented.

#### **7. API Endpoints**
- **Health Checks**: System status monitoring.
- **Log Management**: Upload, collect, parse, store operations.
- **Analysis**: AI-powered multi-layered analysis.
- **Query Interface**: Secure, whitelisted SQL-based log querying.
- **SOUP Updates**: Offline update mechanism with robust security checks and audit logging.

#### **8. Reporting**
- **Multi-format Export**: PDF, CSV, and JSON export capabilities are implemented.

### 🚧 **Partially Implemented Features (5% Complete)**

#### **Frontend Dashboard**
- ✅ React setup with Vite build system.
- ✅ Basic project structure.
- ⚠️ **Missing**: UI components, data visualization, API integration, and interactive features.

#### **Advanced Analysis**
- ✅ Foundation for advanced analysis is in place with the new `DetectionEngine`.
- ⚠️ **Missing**: Trend analysis, correlation between different detection types, advanced reporting visualizations.

#### **Testing Framework**
- ✅ Comprehensive unit and integration tests exist.
- ⚠️ **Status**: Critical backend bugs that would cause test failures have been fixed. Tests now need to be run and aligned with the current implementation to ensure they pass.

### ❌ **Not Implemented Features (5% Complete)**

#### **Network Protocols**
- ❌ SNMP protocol support (mentioned in requirements but not implemented).

#### **Authentication & Authorization**
- ❌ User authentication system (JWT framework is present but not fully integrated).
- ❌ Role-based access control.
- ❌ Session management.

#### **Advanced Reporting**
- ❌ Scheduled reports.
- ❌ Custom report templates.

### **High Priority (Week 1-2)**
1. **AI Model Training**: Train the enhanced AI model using the `enhanced_training.py` script and integrate the new models.
2. **Frontend Development**: Build a minimal viable dashboard for log upload, analysis, and results visualization.
3. **Verify Test Suite**: Run all tests, align them with the current fixed codebase, and ensure the CI pipeline is green.

### **Medium Priority (Week 3-4)**
1. **Implement SOUP Rollback**: Change the simulated rollback to a functional one.
2. **Advanced Analysis**: Implement trend analysis and correlation detection.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Introduce parallel processing and log compression.
