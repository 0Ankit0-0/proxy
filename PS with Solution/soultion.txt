Technology Bucket:	Information Security
Description	
1. Introduction and Problem Statement Analysis The Challenge: Flying Blind in Our Nation's Most Secure Networks For organizations like the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), and in sectors like national defense and critical infrastructure, isolated or "air-gapped" networks are the first line of defense for protecting the most sensitive digital assets. This physical isolation from the internet is a powerful security control, but it creates a critical paradox: the very measure designed to protect these networks also renders standard cybersecurity tools useless. When a security incident occurs—whether from a compromised USB drive, a malicious insider, or a supply chain attack—security teams are left "flying blind." They cannot leverage cloud-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms, download updated threat intelligence, or use remote analysis tools.   This creates a significant operational and security gap. Analysts must physically enter these secure environments and manually collect logs from a multitude of disparate sources, including firewalls, servers, and workstations. They face a "data deluge"—a massive volume of complex, unstructured, and inconsistent log files—without the aid of modern analytical tools. This manual process is slow, inefficient, and prone to human error, drastically increasing incident response times and leaving critical national assets vulnerable for longer. The problem statement from NTRO calls for a solution to this precise challenge: a portable, self-contained, and intelligent log analysis tool designed to function effectively in these offline environments.   
2. The Strategic Gap in the Current Market Our comprehensive analysis of the existing log management market reveals that no current solution adequately addresses the unique constraints of this problem. The market forces a choice between powerful but immobile systems and portable but simplistic tools. The Portability vs. Power Trade-off: Enterprise-grade SIEMs like Splunk, IBM QRadar, and the ELK Stack offer immense analytical power but are heavyweight, resource-intensive platforms requiring dedicated server infrastructure, making them inherently non-portable. Conversely, lightweight tools like GoAccess are highly portable but lack the sophisticated, multi-source correlation and security-centric features needed for a real investigation.   The "Air-Gapped as an Afterthought" Problem: For major vendors, offline deployment is an edge case, not a core design principle. Their documented procedures involve complex, multi-stage workarounds like setting up bastion hosts, manually mirroring entire software repositories and Docker images, and maintaining private container registries within the isolated network. This is far too cumbersome for a rapid, on-site deployment.   The Intelligence Barrier: Modern SIEMs rely heavily on cloud-based AI/ML models and continuous threat intelligence feeds for advanced features like User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA). In an offline environment, these "smart" features are the first casualty, leaving the analyst with a significantly less capable tool.   The Data Silo Dilemma: A portable tool is brought into an environment after an event. It cannot rely on a pre-existing log collection infrastructure. Analysts must manually connect to each device to retrieve log files, a slow process that delays the start of any actual analysis.   This fundamental mismatch between the high-stakes nature of the problem and the constraints of the environment creates a clear strategic gap that Project Quorum is designed to fill. 
3. Proposed Solution: Project Quorum Project Quorum is a portable, self-contained, "Analyst-in-a-Box" security platform designed from the ground up for offline threat hunting and forensic analysis. It is a single, lightweight application that runs on a standard laptop from an encrypted USB drive, delivering the power of an enterprise SIEM without the need for servers or an internet connection. Our innovation is encapsulated in four Unique Selling Propositions (USPs): True Portability with Embedded Power: Project Quorum breaks the power vs. portability trade-off. The entire application—backend, AI engine, database, and UI—is packaged into a single, dependency-free executable. It is designed to run efficiently on standard analyst laptops, a stark contrast to the server-class hardware requirements of traditional SIEMs.   Embedded AI Intelligence with TinyML: We overcome the "Intelligence Barrier" by embedding lightweight, powerful machine learning models directly within the application. Leveraging the principles of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and frameworks like TensorFlow Lite, Project Quorum performs on-device anomaly detection and log pattern analysis. We also integrate lightweight statistical libraries like PyOD for robust, efficient outlier detection, ensuring advanced analytical capabilities are always available, even when completely offline.   Secure, Atomic Offline Update Protocol (SOUP): We treat offline updates as a first-class feature, not a workaround. All updates—threat intelligence, new parsing rules, and improved AI models—are bundled into a single, encrypted, and digitally signed package file. An analyst can import this file via a secure USB drive, and Project Quorum provides a simple, one-click interface to validate the signature and apply the update. This transforms the complex, error-prone manual update processes of current systems into a streamlined and secure operation.   On-the-Fly Log Aggregation: Project Quorum solves the "Data Silo Dilemma" by integrating a mechanism to actively collect logs. From the UI, an analyst can securely deploy temporary, lightweight Python scripts to target systems (via SSH/WinRM). These agents collect the specified logs and stream them back to the Quorum application for centralized analysis, dramatically accelerating the initial data collection phase of an investigation. 
4. Technical Approach and Architecture Project Quorum is built on a modern, lightweight, and feasible technology stack, chosen specifically to meet the demands of a portable, offline environment. Technology Stack: Backend: Python + FastAPI (async, high-performance API) Database: DuckDB (embedded, ultra-fast analytics) AI Engine: TensorFlow Lite + PyOD (on-device anomaly detection) Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS Log Collectors: Python scripts using standard protocols (e.g., SSH) Data Pipeline Methodology: Our solution follows a clear, five-step data pipeline from collection to actionable insight: COLLECT: On-the-fly agents are deployed via SSH/WinRM to pull raw logs (Syslog, EVTX, text files) from target devices and stream them securely to the Quorum application. INGEST & NORMALIZE: Raw logs are ingested, and the engine applies parsing rules to extract key fields. Data is then mapped to a common schema for unified analysis and correlation.   STORE & QUERY: Structured, normalized data is loaded into the embedded DuckDB engine. This enables high-speed, complex SQL-based querying and analysis directly on the analyst's machine.   ANALYZE: The embedded AI engine runs on the data to perform time-series anomaly detection, match indicators against the offline threat intelligence database, and identify suspicious patterns.   VISUALIZE & REPORT: Findings are presented in an interactive dashboard and a unified event timeline. The analyst can generate PDF reports for documentation and evidence. 
5. Feasibility, Viability, and Risk Mitigation 
    a) Technical Feasibility: The solution is highly feasible as it is built entirely on mature, well-documented, and widely-used open-source technologies. Our choice of DuckDB for the data store and TinyML principles for the AI engine specifically addresses the performance challenges of running on standard hardware.   
    b) Operational Feasibility: The "zero-setup" portable design is ready for immediate use in high-pressure, isolated environments, providing a stark contrast to the complex offline installation procedures of existing enterprise tools.   Timeline Attainability: Our phased development plan prioritizes a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with core functionality, ensuring we can deliver a working solution that meets the evaluation criteria for a prototype within the hackathon timeframe.   
    c) Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies: 
        Performance on Low-Resource Hardware: Slow data processing could hinder real-time investigation on standard laptops. To address this, Project Sentinel’s architecture is optimized for performance, using DuckDB, an embedded database for fast analytical queries, and TinyML principles to run lightweight, quantized AI models with minimal CPU and RAM usage. Diverse & Complex Log Formats: The inability to parse proprietary logs could limit the tool’s effectiveness. The MVP includes pre-built parsers for critical log sources like Syslog and Windows EVTX, and post-MVP we will provide a Custom Parser Editor, enabling analysts to add new log formats themselves. AI Model Effectiveness: Embedded models may generate more false positives than cloud-scale alternatives. To mitigate this, we adopt a Hybrid AI Approach, combining robust statistical algorithms from PyOD for reliable baseline anomaly detection with optimized deep learning models for specific threat patterns, balancing accuracy with on-device performance. 
6. Impact and Benefits Project Quorum will directly empower security analysts at the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) and other defense, intelligence, and critical infrastructure sectors. National Security Benefits: Drastically Reduces Incident Response Time: Enables analysts to detect, investigate, and neutralize threats within critical isolated networks far more quickly, minimizing potential damage.   Enhances Proactive Threat Hunting: Provides the tools to proactively hunt for advanced persistent threats (APTs) and insider threats that traditional methods would miss. Improves Forensic Integrity: Creates a clear, correlated, and auditable trail of evidence for post-breach analysis and reporting. Economic & Operational Benefits: Minimizes Critical Infrastructure Downtime: Faster troubleshooting of operational faults in isolated Industrial Control Systems (ICS) reduces costly service interruptions. Increases Analyst Efficiency: Automates the most time-consuming tasks (log collection, parsing, correlation), freeing up highly skilled personnel for high-value analysis.   Low Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): As a software-only solution, it eliminates the need for expensive dedicated server hardware, complex maintenance, and recurring cloud subscription costs. 
7. Conclusion Project Quorum is not just another log analysis tool; it is a paradigm shift for security operations in the nation's most secure and sensitive environments. By breaking the trade-off between analytical power and portability, and by designing for offline use from the ground up, we provide security analysts with the modern, intelligent tools they need to defend critical digital assets, regardless of network connectivity. Our vision is to make advanced threat hunting and rapid incident response possible, anywhere, anytime.

Abstract/Summary	
The Problem: A Critical Security Blind Spot in Our Nation's Most Secure Networks In high-security environments like those managed by the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), isolated or "air-gapped" networks are a fundamental security measure. While this physical isolation protects against remote network-based attacks, it creates a critical blind spot for on-site incident response and threat hunting. When a security incident occurs—whether from a malicious insider, a compromised USB drive, or a supply chain attack—standard, cloud-reliant Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools are rendered useless. Security analysts are forced to enter these secure zones and manually collect a "data deluge" of logs from dozens of disparate sources like firewalls, servers, and workstations. This process is slow, inefficient, and prone to human error, leaving critical national assets vulnerable while analysts struggle to piece together evidence from a chaotic mix of unstructured data.   The Strategic Gap: Why Existing Tools Fail Our comprehensive market analysis reveals that no existing solution effectively addresses this challenge. The market forces a stark choice: Powerful but Immobile: Enterprise-grade SIEMs like Splunk, IBM QRadar, and the ELK Stack offer immense analytical power but are heavyweight platforms requiring dedicated server infrastructure, making them inherently non-portable. Their procedures for offline deployment and updates are complex, cumbersome workarounds involving bastion hosts and manual repository mirroring, not streamlined workflows.   
Portable but Simplistic: Lightweight forensic tools are portable but lack the sophisticated, multi-source correlation and AI-driven analytical capabilities needed to detect advanced threats in a complex network environment.   This leaves a critical gap for a tool that combines the intelligence of an enterprise SIEM with the portability and offline-first design required for fieldwork. Our Solution: Project Quorum - An "Analyst-in-a-Box" Project Quorum is a portable, self-contained, AI-driven log intelligence platform designed from the ground up for secure, offline environments. It is a single, lightweight application that runs on a standard laptop from an encrypted USB drive, delivering the power of a security operations center (SOC) directly to the analyst in the field. Our innovation is built on four Unique Selling Propositions (USPs): True Portability with Embedded Power: We break the power vs. portability trade-off. The entire application—backend, AI engine, database, and UI—is packaged into a single, dependency-free executable with a low resource footprint. Embedded AI Intelligence with TinyML: We overcome the "Intelligence Barrier" by embedding lightweight, powerful machine learning models directly within the application. Using TinyML principles with frameworks like TensorFlow Lite and statistical libraries like PyOD, Project Quorum performs on-device anomaly detection and log pattern analysis without needing an internet connection.   Secure, Atomic Offline Update Protocol (SOUP): We replace complex manual update procedures with a simple, secure, one-click process. All updates (threat intelligence, parsing rules, AI models) are bundled into a single, digitally signed package file that can be safely imported and applied offline. On-the-Fly Log Aggregation: We solve the "Data Silo Dilemma" by integrating a module that allows the analyst to deploy temporary, lightweight collection agents to target systems via standard protocols (e.g., SSH), pulling all necessary logs into a central analysis workspace automatically. Technical Feasibility and Innovative Architecture Project Quorum's feasibility is grounded in a carefully selected, modern, and lightweight technology stack: Backend: A high-performance API built with Python and FastAPI. Embedded Data Store: We use DuckDB, a serverless, in-process analytical database. This is a key innovation, as DuckDB provides incredibly fast SQL query performance on large datasets directly on a laptop, eliminating the need for a heavy database server and making our tool truly portable and efficient.   AI Engine: A hybrid approach using TensorFlow Lite for optimized deep learning models and the PyOD library for a rich suite of classical, lightweight anomaly detection algorithms.   Frontend: A modern, responsive UI built with React and packaged with Tauri, which produces smaller and more performant cross-platform desktop applications than alternatives like Electron. Our methodology follows a clear five-step pipeline: Collect -> Ingest & Parse -> Store & Query -> Analyze -> Visualize & Report, ensuring a logical and efficient workflow for the analyst. Impact and Vision Project Quorum will directly empower security analysts at the NTRO and other critical national security organizations. By automating the most time-consuming aspects of offline log analysis and equipping analysts with powerful AI-driven insights, our solution will drastically reduce incident response times, enhance the ability to proactively hunt for advanced threats, and ultimately strengthen the security posture of our nation's most sensitive digital assets. Our vision is to provide every security analyst with the tools they need to defend critical infrastructure, regardless of network connectivity, making advanced threat intelligence possible, anywhere, anytime.
