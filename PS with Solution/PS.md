# SIH25235 - Portable Log Analysis Tool for Isolated Networks

## 🛰️ Problem Statement
**Title:** Portable Log Analysis Tool for Isolated Network  
**Category:** Software  
**Technology Bucket:** Smart Automation  
**Organization Type:** Industry Personnel  

---

## 🧠 Background
Continuous monitoring of systems and network activities is crucial for detecting, preventing, and responding to cybersecurity threats.  
Security Operation Centres (SOCs) play a vital role in providing situational awareness by continuously monitoring logs and events across an organization’s infrastructure. This enables near real-time detection of malicious activity.

However, when dealing with **multiple isolated (air-gapped) networks**, central monitoring is not always possible. Each isolated environment must independently monitor its own logs. Periodic aggregation of these logs to a central system may be done manually or through secure offline transfer mechanisms.

---

## 📋 Detailed Description
This problem statement envisions the development of a **portable, self-contained log analysis tool** that can operate **completely offline** within isolated network environments.

The solution should:
- Run autonomously within disconnected environments.
- Monitor cybersecurity events and anomalies.
- Detect attacks using multiple analytical techniques such as:
  - **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**
  - **Signature-based detection**
  - **Anomaly and heuristic analysis**
  - **Behavioural and rule-based detection**
  - **Network traffic analysis**
  - **Threat intelligence feeds (offline)**

A simplified, secure mechanism should be included for **updating** the tool and its intelligence modules when required.

---

## 🎯 Expected Solution
The solution should be a **portable, easy-to-use log analysis tool** capable of:
- **Collecting**, **parsing**, and **analyzing logs** from various system and network devices.
- **Operating entirely offline** to ensure privacy and compliance with air-gapped network policies.
- Being easily **deployed across platforms** (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- **Exporting analysis results** in readable and reportable formats.

## ⚙️ Key Features Expected

### 1. 🧳 Portability
- Deployable across Windows, Linux, and Mac.
- Minimal setup required (single executable or USB-based package).

### 2. 🔗 Multi-source Log Collection
- Collect logs from different devices and sources.
- Support for **Syslog**, **FTP**, **USB**, and other offline-compatible protocols.

### 3. 📜 Log Parsing & Normalization
- Support for heterogeneous log formats.
- Convert raw logs into structured, standardized formats for analysis.

### 4. 🧩 Log Analysis
- Basic analysis functions:
  - Searching and filtering.
  - Highlighting suspicious or anomalous events.
- AI-assisted anomaly detection (heuristic + rule-based).

### 5. 🖥️ User Interface
- Simple and intuitive **web-based or graphical interface**.
- Usable by both technical and non-technical personnel.

### 6. 🚫 Offline Functionality
- Full functionality without internet access.
- Offline model updates via secure, signed files.

### 7. 🔐 Security
- Secure handling and storage of log data.
- Optional user authentication for restricted access.
- Digital signatures for update integrity.

### 8. 📊 Reporting
- Generate visual and textual reports.
- Export options (PDF, CSV, JSON) for external use.
