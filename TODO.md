# Sidebar Upgrade Plan

## Information Gathered
- Current Sidebar.jsx uses plain React, Tailwind CSS, emoji icons, and basic transitions.
- Dependencies available: framer-motion, lucide-react, Shadcn UI components (Button, etc.), Tailwind CSS with custom theme.
- UI aesthetic: Dark theme with green accents (#00FF88), custom colors defined in tailwind.config.cjs and theme.css.
- Sidebar features: Collapsible, navigation menu with active state, toggle button.
- Integration: Used in App.jsx with props for activeView, onViewChange, isCollapsed, onToggleCollapse.

## Plan
- Upgrade Sidebar.jsx to use Lucide React icons instead of emojis.
- Integrate Shadcn Button component for menu items and toggle button.
- Add Framer Motion animations for smooth collapse/expand, hover effects, and active state transitions.
- Ensure styling matches the dark theme and green accent colors.
- Maintain all existing functionality and props to avoid breaking integration.

## Dependent Files to Edit
- frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx: Main file to upgrade.

## Followup Steps
- Test the sidebar collapse/expand functionality.
- Verify navigation works and active state is correct.
- Check visual consistency with the rest of the UI.
- Run the app to ensure no integration issues.
